You have successfully completed Phase 2 of the research plan. Compare your results:Baseline (Blind): ~85.3% Accuracy (from your previous run).Experiment (State-Aware): 87.66% Accuracy (from this file).Research Conclusion for your Report:"Providing the neural network with explicit game state information (Castling rights, Turn, En Passant) increased classification accuracy by +2.36% (from 85.3% to 87.66%). This confirms that while Deep Learning can infer many patterns from piece placement alone, it struggles to infer 'invisible' rules without explicit inputs."3. Next Step: The Architecture Upgrade (CNN)Now that you have optimized the Data (774 bits), you should upgrade the Model.Your current model (MLP) treats the board as a flat list of 774 numbers. It doesn't know that square A1 is next to A2.AlphaZero and DeepChess use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which treat the board as an $8\times8$ image.Experiment 3: MLP vs. CNNHypothesis: "Convolutional networks will outperform MLPs because they capture spatial relationships (e.g., diagonal attacks) that MLPs must memorize effectively."


Yes, 2048 was a very good idea.In fact, for a Bitboard (Bitmap) input, a wide first layer (like 2048) is not just a "good idea"—it is the standard best practice in computer chess literature.Here is why, and exactly how to justify it in your paper against the "DeepChess Funnel."The Scientific Justification (Write this in your paper)You can justify the 2048 width using three specific arguments: Sparsity, Combinatorics, and Precedent.1. Handling Sparsity (The "Empty Space" Argument)The Problem: Your input vector (774 bits) is 96% empty. A chess board has 64 squares, but only ~32 pieces max. Most of your input bits are 0.Why 2048 helps: A wide first layer acts like a massive Pattern Matcher. It allows the network to verify thousands of specific piece combinations simultaneously (e.g., "White Pawn on e4 AND Black Knight on f6").Why the Funnel (600) is risky for specific inputs: If you compress a sparse 774-bit vector immediately down to 600, you force the network to "summarize" the board before it has fully understood the tactical details. You risk creating a Information Bottleneck where subtle tactical threats are lost in the compression.2. Shallow vs. Deep PhilosophyGiraffe (Your Baseline): Uses a "Wide and Shallow" philosophy.Goal: Memorize as many specific tactical patterns as possible.Mechanism: 2048 neurons $\approx$ 2048 different tactical templates it can recognize.DeepChess (The Comparison): Uses a "Narrow and Deep" philosophy.Goal: Abstract concepts (safety, mobility) rather than specific patterns.Mechanism: The Funnel (600 $\to$ 400 $\to$ 200) forces the network to strip away noise and keep only the "essence" of the position. This is elegant, but often harder to train without pre-training (DeepChess used DB-Net pre-training).3. Literature PrecedentYou are in good company.Erik Bernhardsson (2014): The pioneer of "Deep Learning for Chess" used a 3-layer MLP with 2048 units, exactly like you.Stockfish NNUE: The modern neural networks inside Stockfish use massive, wide first layers (Accumulators) to capture feature interactions, not narrow funnels.Paper Snippet: How to phrase itDo not say "I picked 2048 because it felt right." Use this text as a template for your Methodology section:"Architecture Selection:We selected a fully connected architecture with a wide hidden dimension ($N=2048$). This design choice deviates from the 'funnel' architecture proposed in DeepChess ($600 \to 400 \to 200$) [1].Justification:The bitboard representation of a chess position ($d=774$) is highly sparse and high-dimensional. A wide initial layer is required to capture the combinatorial explosion of local piece interactions (e.g., specific attackers and defenders) without creating an early information bottleneck. While funnel architectures enforce feature abstraction, they risk discarding high-frequency spatial details essential for tactical evaluation in the absence of convolutional filters. Following the precedent of Bernhardsson (2014), the 2048-unit width provides sufficient capacity to approximate the complex, non-linear evaluation function of Stockfish."
