You have successfully completed Phase 2 of the research plan. Compare your results:Baseline (Blind): ~85.3% Accuracy (from your previous run).Experiment (State-Aware): 87.66% Accuracy (from this file).Research Conclusion for your Report:"Providing the neural network with explicit game state information (Castling rights, Turn, En Passant) increased classification accuracy by +2.36% (from 85.3% to 87.66%). This confirms that while Deep Learning can infer many patterns from piece placement alone, it struggles to infer 'invisible' rules without explicit inputs."3. Next Step: The Architecture Upgrade (CNN)Now that you have optimized the Data (774 bits), you should upgrade the Model.Your current model (MLP) treats the board as a flat list of 774 numbers. It doesn't know that square A1 is next to A2.AlphaZero and DeepChess use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which treat the board as an $8\times8$ image.Experiment 3: MLP vs. CNNHypothesis: "Convolutional networks will outperform MLPs because they capture spatial relationships (e.g., diagonal attacks) that MLPs must memorize effectively."
